# Shiver
Shiver is a **_simple student assessment management system_** for the students of Ateneo de Davao Univesity - School of Education. It's designed to let the students monitor their semester grades, account balance, registration information, curriculum, professor and school information, class offerings, and general semestral schedule, to name a few. Additionally, the respective teachers for each course have access to their student's grades. Teachers can monitor, make changes, finalize, submit, and distribute their students' grades through the system. They can also easily search for a student with a search function that automates the whole process.

The term _shiver_ is used to call a group of sharks in the wild. It is also what students feel when they are about to see their grades and fees.
